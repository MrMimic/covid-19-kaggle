In fact, it can be very difficult to quickly get reliable information: many different points of view are represented in the medias as well as in the scientific litterature.\n\nInstead of simply returning the most closest sentences to the query, we chose to **extract the different opinions**, which can be shared by the different groups of people working on a subject.\n\nShowing an exemple of our results on Chloroquine in this notebook, might motivate one to read further on the topic or to use our tool for the various tasks of the challenge.\n\nThis notebook proove according to us, that opinion extraction can be useful to the community.\n\n### How it works \n\n#### Database creation\n\nAll titles, abstracts and body texts of the dataset have been [inserted into an SQLite DB](https://github.com/MrMimic/covid-19-kaggle/blob/master/src/main/python/c19/database_utilities.py#L186) (only english articles for the moment). \n\nThey have been preprocessed by using the [method we developed](https://github.com/MrMimic/covid-19-kaggle/blob/master/src/main/python/c19/text_preprocessing.py#L21). It will lower and stem the text, remove stopwords, remove numeric values, etc.\n\nA [word2vec](https://radimrehurek.com/gensim/models/word2vec.html) embedding and a [TF-IDF](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.feature_extraction.text.TfidfVectorizer.html) models have been trained on this pre-processed corpus. Briefly, these models allow to get a fixed-length vector to represent each word of the corpus (word2vec) and to weight each word regarding it's frequency among all the corpus and in each document (TF-IDF). The result is a parquet table, [stored on Github](https://github.com/MrMimic/covid-19-kaggle/blob/master/resources/global_df_w2v_tfidf.parquet), containing for each word a float vector and a TF-IDF score. \n\n![Table header](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MrMimic/covid-19-kaggle/master/images/header_w2v_tfidf.png \"Logo Title Text 1\")\n\nThe file can be re-generated in more or less 30 minutes on a 8 vCPU machine by using [this script](https://github.com/MrMimic/covid-19-kaggle/blob/master/src/main/scripts/train_w2v.py).\n\nEach sentence from the corpus have been pre-processed and [vectorized](https://github.com/MrMimic/covid-19-kaggle/blob/master/src/main/python/c19/embedding.py#L65). To do so, each pre-processed word from a sentence is represented by its vector and weithed by the TF-IDF score. Then, all vectors from the different words composing the sentence are averaged ([Mean of Word Embeddings](https://books.google.fr/books?id=tBxrDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA95&lpg=PA95&dq=mean+of+word+embedding+MOWE&source=bl&ots=7laX_HWKS0&sig=ACfU3U2DvGwGI6Bs4HTkX0_oP7Nf3UTP2A&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiXguOJ9tjoAhX3D2MBHS6mAzoQ6AEwCnoECA0QKA#v=onepage&q=mean%20of%20word%20embedding%20MOWE&f=false)). All these pre-processed sentences are [stored in base](https://github.com/MrMimic/covid-19-kaggle/blob/master/src/main/python/c19/text_preprocessing.py#L151).\n\n#### Query matching\n\nThe query is first [vectorised](https://github.com/MrMimic/covid-19-kaggle/blob/master/src/main/python/c19/query_matching.py#L57) by using the same strategy and tool as explained above. The cosine similarity of this sentence [versus all stored sentences](https://github.com/MrMimic/covid-19-kaggle/blob/master/src/main/python/c19/query_matching.py#L127) vectors is then computed. Briefly, it allows to check how each sentence of the dataset is close from the query. Only the top-k sentences are returned (filtered either by minimal distance or by a fixed number of top-k sentences).\n\nAll these top-k closest sentences are then clusterised by a Kmean algorithm. These clusters will represent the different opinions found about the query.\n\nOnly the closest sentence from each centroid is returned (*ie*, the sentence reflecting the most the opinion on this subject).\n\n### What's cool\n\n- The trained embedding is not generic. Even if pre-trained models found on the Internet work well, the context of covid-19 and the kind of sentences to be processed make a locally trained embedding better.\n- Code is highly optimisez for RAM and rapid processing. Only the resulting DB weights gigabytes.\n\n### What's not\n\n- The database containing all sentences weights more than 25Go. It is thus unusable on Kaggle. To overcome this issue, we had to select randomly 10 sentences from the body.\n\n### What's next\n\nVersion 2.0 of this work should be released soon. To come:\n\n- Ranking best papers of opinions clusters by using a citation network (see our current work on that [NOTEBOOK](https://www.kaggle.com/baptistemetge/citation-network) ) and maybe some extra metadata (the authors, the journals,etc.). \n- Auto-estimate K for the number of opinions.\n- Auto-test the code on Github with unitary tests on the methods.\n- Etc ;)\n\nAnd during the round #2, we would to develop:\n\n- A multi-lingual search (maybe with trained embedding on different languages instead of just translating the query).\n- Use a larger pre-trained embedding (on the same corpus but maybe with some data augmentation from PubMed about given subjects).\n\n### Usage\n\nQueries from the different tasks have been reformulated and [stored in Github](https://github.com/MrMimic/covid-19-kaggle/blob/master/resources/queries.json). All of them have been sent to the pipeline and the result are store in markdown format here.\n\nFor this notebook, we will focus on a given task and try to answer by using our tool."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Setup\n\nThe library can be easily [installed from
