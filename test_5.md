	- There has been some person to person spread, including a family in Guandoing, and a single case which infected 14 health workers. ([10.31646/gbio.50](https://www.doi.org/10.31646/gbio.50))

	- BACKGROUND Person to person spread of COIVD-19 in the UK has now been confirmed. ([10.1101/2020.03.06.20032144](https://www.doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.06.20032144))

	- 2 The previously-unknown virus in question was later found to be highly transmissible, with the average infected person spreading the disease to up to 3 other people. ([10.1016/j.sapharm.2020.03.017](https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.sapharm.2020.03.017))

	- Also focusing on rapid AST testing, the work by GeneFluidics Inc. (2019) [156] has resulted in a fully automated system that uses a reagent kit and disposable sensor array to quantify species-specific 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA). ([10.3390/s19081917](https://www.doi.org/10.3390/s19081917))

	- With the possible expansion of 2019-nCoV globally [8] and the declaration of the 2019-nCoV outbreak as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern by the World Health Organization, there is an urgent need for rapid diagnostics, vaccines and therapeutics to detect, prevent and contain 2019-nCoV promptly. ([10.3390/jcm9030623](https://www.doi.org/10.3390/jcm9030623))

	- We advocate that funding for biopreparedness efforts, including outbreak investigation and response efforts; building of infrastructure; development of novel diagnostics, therapeutics and vaccines; and maintenance of this preparedness against HHCDs remain a high priority. ([10.3390/v11090773](https://www.doi.org/10.3390/v11090773))


**Cluster 1:**

	- While the world are jointing efforts to develop diagnostics, therapeutics, and vaccines to fight against COVID-19, information about cultivation, purification and super molecular structure of SARS-CoV-2 in their native state is in need urgently. ([10.1101/2020.03.02.972927](https://www.doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.02.972927))

	- Investment in research and development is required to guide novel, affordable, and effective strategies and tools for timely preparedness and emergency response/containment, point of care diagnostics, and safe and effective vaccines and drugs. ([10.5001/omj.2019.73](https://www.doi.org/10.5001/omj.2019.73))

	- CARB-X provides financial, scientific, and business support for antibiotics, vaccines, rapid diagnostics, and other products for resistant bacterial infections. ([10.3389/fimmu.2019.00549](https://www.doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2019.00549))
